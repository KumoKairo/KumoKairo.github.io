KumoKairo started working in gamedev in 2013 with Adobe Flash and ActionScript 3. Was introduced to Unity in 2014 and been mostly working with it since then. Interested in realtime graphics, optimization and related tech. 

Tinkering with Godot since 2.x. 

Currently working on a web-first game engine mostly written in Dart.

Should probably add links to projects. Maybe next time.
